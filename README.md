  <p align="center">Chess Game Nest.js Backend API</p>
    <p align="center">

## Description

This project includes an API for managing chess games. The API likely provides endpoints for creating new games,
making moves, retrieving game state, accessing move history, and potentially other game-related operations.
It enables developers to interact with the chess game system programmatically,
integrating it into other applications or building additional features on top of it.
